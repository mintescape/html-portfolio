<h1>The Best Movie According to Mintes</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies/Shows of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Ghost In The Shell</h3>
<p>I havent ever finished the movie, but the art style and vibe have stuck with me for years.
    The cyberpunk theme plus the existential questioning on what it means to be human,
    and the stark distinction between plotics and humanity.
</p>

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Only romance movie I love. The theme of love trancending memories of good times
    and just being a result of a fated union of souls is so beautiful. Plus,
    its very refreshing seening Jim Carrey in a serious-ish role.
</p>

<h3>Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Gorgeous movie and one of the first and best black superhero representation.
    Miles is so relateable, and the process of finding his own place as a Spiderman
    in a world that already had an excellent Spiderman for years. Having to fill that role
    unexpectedly tells a very poignant story about accepting responsibility inspite
    of not asking for it, instead because ones ability requires it of them.
